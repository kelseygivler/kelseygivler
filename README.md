### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm still figuring out how to do this stuff but! This could be a work in progress in the future? I didn't put much (or really any) work into this website (yet!) but I did at least figure out how to create it which I had a much harder time doing than I'm willing to admit... 
I hope this counts with the extra credit but you know what, even if it doesn't thats okay because I'm pretty glad that I was even able to figure out how to make this work.
